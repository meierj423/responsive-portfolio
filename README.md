# responsive-portfolio

This webpage inclues three links: an About Me page, a Portfolio page, and a Contact page.

1). The About Me page inclues a Navbar with my name in the top left corner along with the links to the other two pages on the top right corner. Also, an image of my family and a short biographer is located within the About Me page.

2). The Portfolio page is where I will be showcasing my future projects. This page also includes an identical Navbar to the About Me page.

3). The Contact page is where viewers of my webpage can give me their name, email address, and a message they would like me to see. Once again, this page includes an identical Navbar to the other two pages.

This is a mobile-first webpage with responsive content.
